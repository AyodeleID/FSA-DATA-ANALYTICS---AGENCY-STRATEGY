# Agency Strategy: FSA Data Analytics

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyse the distribution of donors acquired by a face-to-face marketing company across Canada, focusing on which forward sortation areas (FSAs) and demographics are most responsive.

## Data and Methods
- **Donor sign-up data** including FSA, campaign channel and commitment level.
- **Demographic data** by FSA (income, population) from public sources.
- Analysis scripts in Python for data processing, visualisation and statistical modelling.

## Insights
The analysis identifies high-potential regions for future campaigns and highlights demographic segments that respond well to face-to-face outreach. Visualisations include heatmaps and bar charts of donor density and commitment levels.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb` or the Python script.
3. Figures will be saved to the `figures/` directory.
